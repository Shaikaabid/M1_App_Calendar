# INTRODUCTION
The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used civil calendar in the world which starts form 1600. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582. 
The calendar spaces leap years to make the average year 365.2425 days long, approximating the 365.2422 day tropical year that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun. 
Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is a leap year.
The calendar was developed as a correction to the Julian calendar, shortening the average year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar. The Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar with 12 months of 28â€“31 days each. 
A regular Gregorian year consists of 365 days, but in certain years known as leap years, a leap day is added to February. In the Julian calendar, a leap year occurred every 4 years, and the leap day was inserted by doubling 24 February. The Gregorian reform omitted a leap day in three of every 400 years and left the leap day unchanged. However, it has become customary in the modern period to number the days sequentially with no gaps, and 29 February is typically considered as the leap day. 
Calendar cycles repeat completely every 400 years, which equals 146,097 days. Of these 400 years, 303 are regular years of 365 days and 97 are leap years of 366 days. A mean calendar year is 365 97/400 days = 365.2425 days, or 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes and 12 seconds.
Logic behind daycode: A common year starting on Monday is any non-leap year (i.e., a year with 365 days) that begins on Monday, 1 January, and ends on Monday, 31 December. The current year, 2018, is a common year starting on Monday in the Gregorian calendar. The last such year was 2007 and the next such years will be 2029, 2035, 2046, 2057, 2063, 2074, 2085, 2091, 2103, 2114, 2125, and 2131, or likewise, 2013 and 2019 in the obsolete Julian calendar. 
The century year, 1900, was also a common year starting on Monday in the Gregorian calendar. See below for more. Any common year that starts on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday has two Friday the 13ths. This common year of this type contains two Friday the 13ths in April and July. Leap years starting on Sunday share this characteristic, but also have another in January.
